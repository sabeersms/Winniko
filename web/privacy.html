        <h1>Privacy Policy for Winniko</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: January 2026</strong></p>

        <p>At Winniko, accessible from our mobile application, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect several types of information to provide and improve our service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Identifiers:</strong> Name, email address, and phone number.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Assets:</strong> Profile pictures (collected via your Camera or Gallery permissions).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Approximate location data to localize competition listings and organizer
                details.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Activity:</strong> Your predictions, competition participation, and app interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> Device identifiers, IP address, and crash reports for performance

        </ul>

        <h2>2. Payment Information</h2>
        <p>If you participate in paid contests, we use third-party payment processors (specifically Razorpay). We do not
            store your credit card or bank details on our servers. All financial transactions are processed securely by
            Razorpay in compliance with PCI-DSS standards.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services & Ads</h2>
        <p>We use third-party SDKs that may collect information used to identify you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads (AdMob):</strong> Used to serve advertisements. They may collect device
                identifiers and usage data to personalize your ad experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> Used for authentication, database, storage, and push notifications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use your data to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manage your account and competition rankings.</li>
            <li>Process entries and score calculations.</li>
            <li>Notify you about match results and competition updates.</li>
            <li>Prevent fraud and ensure a fair playing field.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
        <p>We retain your data as long as your account is active. You have the right to delete your account and all
            associated personal data at any time. Go to <strong>Profile > Settings > Delete Account</strong> inside the
            app. This action is irreversible and will permanently remove your profile, competition history, and indices
            from our database.</p>
